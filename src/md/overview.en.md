POW Summit 2023 is a unique conference which will bring the major Proof of Work (POW) communities together around our common cause.  After Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (POS), the mainstream narrative is that POW is obsolete technology and is entirely environmentally unfriendly.  This conference will highlight the unique merits of POW and related topics:

- • Why maximal decentralization is so important
- • Censorship resistance and avoidance of capture
- • POW environmental sustainability (POW can be carbon-negative)
- • Privacy technology

There will be many well-known keynote speakers with a distinct OG flavor, together with a strong slate of speakers from each of the participating POW projects.

These overarching themes are accessible for all audiences.  They are not unique to miners, or developers, or to end-users.  They are universal and hugely important.  We want to take attendees back to basics - explaining the pre-Bitcoin landscape, talking through cypherpunk origins, encryption-as-a-munition, Napster, Bitgold, B-money, and then the birth of Bitcoin and POW.  We will explain why these fundamentals are still so important in 2022.

There have been mining conferences.  There have been plenty of Bitcoin-only conferences, but to our knowledge there has never been a pluralist conference with an overarching focus on POW and on blockchain fundamentals.   The vast majority of people in the blockchain ecosystem were not around in the early days and have likely never heard the origin stories.

We aim to attract around 500 attendees, with sponsors from the mining world, Bitcoin service companies, and from companies involved in the ecosystems of the collaborating POW projects.  This is not a profit-making enterprise.  Sponsorship is just intended to offset costs for the speakers and the organization - and especially so that we can pay keynote speakers who require speaking fees.

The event will be organized by Emma Todd and MMH Group under contract to the ETC Cooperative.

The content will be a collaboration between ETC Cooperative, Litecoin Foundation and individuals from the ZCash, Dogecoin and Monero and Bitcoin ecosystems.  In addition to the keynotes there will be project-specific streams of content, together with mining sessions and other sub-themes as seem appropriate.
